# ChatApp

- The current project constains a C# [Server .exe](https://github.com/AndreiZacordonet/ChatApp/blob/main/ServerApp/bin/Debug/ServerApp.exe) file and  [Client .exe](https://github.com/AndreiZacordonet/ChatApp/blob/main/Clients/ChatApp/bin/Debug/ChatApp.exe) file. 
- The message logs are stored in the same place as the clients .exe so its best to place the clients in different folders.
- As database engine, the server manages the users with a interface to MySQL management class.
- [DLL folder](https://github.com/AndreiZacordonet/ChatApp/tree/main/DLL) contains all libraries that the project need to run.
- You might need to install MySQL.Data and Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces and some JSON dependency.
